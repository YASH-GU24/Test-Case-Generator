# Test-Case-Generator
 Paste the Brute Force code in brute_force.cpp
 Paste the Optimised code in optimised.cpp

 Add the lines
	freopen ("output1.txt", "w", stdout);
	freopen ("input.txt", "r", stdin);
At the starting of main function of the Brute Force code so the text files can be used as io streams

 Add the lines
	freopen ("output2.txt", "w", stdout);
	freopen ("input.txt", "r", stdin);
At the starting of main function of Optimised code so the text files can be used as io streams

Then in script.py put the constraints given and run the script
